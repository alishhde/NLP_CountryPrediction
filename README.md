# Natural Language Processing - Country Prediction with Vecor Space Model

The notebook existing in this repo is the solution to predicting the countries name based on its capital. What have been done is that I tried to find a pattern between countries and their capitals, in the training phase. Then, by this pattern I tried to find the countries based on their capitals. In other words, by knowing the fact "Every word can be shown as a vector" I tried to find a relation between capitals'name and their countries' name and in the following with the help of this, I created a predictor, which gets a capital in input and tells its country in output.

The accuracy of this project is ~ 92.
